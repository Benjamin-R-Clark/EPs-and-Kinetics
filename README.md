# EPs-and-Kinetics
Master thesis workspace focusing on the effects of enhancer-promoter contacts on transcritptional kinetics.


This space is currently under construction, I'm slowly adding md presentations and figures.

  Work repos for identfying super enhancers (SEs) from chipseq files in MEFs and mESCs. I use these annotations with H3K27ac HICHIP chromatin loops to map promoters with SEs. I then incorporate transcriptional kinetics data to determine what effect these linkages have. I have sample bash scripts and short nextflow pipelines to show how I did secondary analysis (alignment, peak calling and SE calling). The final analysis is in R or R-markdown such as:
